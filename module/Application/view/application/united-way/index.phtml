    		<p>Now more than ever, city government and community nonprofits are depending on each other to help our constituents during these incredibly challenging times. We are lucky in Middletown to have such wonderful partners in the Middlesex United Way, which has stepped up again and again during the COVID-19 pandemic to support our most vulnerable residents. Supporting United Way means supporting local nonprofits all throughout Middletown - keeping your charitable dollars right here at home, where they go the furthest and matter the most. I want to thank Ramona Burkey for her leadership of the City of Middletown's giving campaign, and encourage everyone to give what they are able to support our local nonprofits through the Middlesex United Way.</p>
